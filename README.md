# Proof

### What is Proof

Proof was inspired by our groups love of drinking and specifically our love of drinking whiskey. The project was designed to be a one stop database for all the various types of whiskey to assist the user in making a selection. It also provides some cool recipes for the user to try at home and will help the user locate a local bar to drink some whiskey at.

### Why use Proof

After the initial setup Proof will utilize crowdsourcing to continue growing the whiskeys, recipes and local bars databases. Proof also requires the user to create a profile initially to ensure the usuer is of legal age. Down the line we would could potentially envision adding a social element to proof. Maybe it could track the various whiskeys, recipes and bars the user has tried and develop a unique user created rating system amongst friends and other users, maybe it could link into a loyalty program at a local watering hole or be used for promotions of new whiskeys or bars.

### Getting Started with Proof

As Proof is a passion project, it is free to use and always will be. To get started with Proof simply create a profile and then navigate to one of the three main pages to search various types of whiskeys, recipes and local bars. As previously mentioned above Proof utilizes crowdsourcing to continue growing and stay up to date with the latest information, so if you don't see a whiskey, a recipe or your favorite new bar on the list feel free to add it.
